            <h1>GHOSTFLAME</h1>
            <p>
                GHOSTFLAME is a fast-paced top-down game featuring 3D-inspired movement, speed-driven mechanics, and a stylized cybernetic world.
                <!--GHOSTFLAME began its life in December 2023 as a top down speedrunning game with only the ability to move the character and run. 
                I decided to use the project as the base for my 2D Animation class. I ended up making moodboards, sketches, and more stylized sprites and animations.
                This process helped me create an industrial & cybernetic world I wanted to create with gameplay I only hadn't attempted due to the complexity at my programming level.
                From then on I continued to push myself outside of my comfort zone, implementing systems such as multi-layered enemy targeting, dynamic movement,
                and custom 3D movement and collision in a top down 2D perspective. With GhostFlame I am pushing for a high level of growth and mastery with its high-speed 
                gameplay,  various movement mechanics, branching levels with challenging and hidden shortcuts, and a ranking system that rewards high skilled play.-->

                <!--I draw my ideas in a notebook. Over time I cut out mechanics, environments, gimmicks, designs, etc. that don't contribute to the 
                game's core gameplay or deviate too far from the game's main focus. From there I implement quick versions of these 
                ideas to further decide whether it will serve a meaningful purpose to the sector of the game it realates to such as player traversal 
                or the world's industrial theme. The goal of streamlining these ideas is to make the feeling of player driven high-speed action
                more impactful and digestable. This lead me to devise this structure for <Ghostflame:-->
            I sketch ideas, cut those that don’t fit the core, and prototype the rest to test their impact on traversal or theme. 
            Streamlining heightens the game’s high-speed action. Ghostflame’s progression is driven by player performance, with 
            higher ranks unlocking additional keys, which open later areas and stages.
                <!--GhostFlame's structure follows a small hub area includes one main stage, two sub stages, and a bossfight. 
                To progress to the next area the player needs a certain number of keys. The way the player is awarded 
                these keys is dependant on their mastery of each of GHOSTFLAME's systems. Each level ranks the player 
                based on damage taken, collected tris, and the most heavy influencer is time of completion. Completing a 
                stage awards you one key but S-ranking a stage will award you with an extra key. The same applies for defeating bosses. 
                This allows for non-linear progression that the speed of which is dependant on Player mastery over the game's mechanics.>-->

                <!--
                I design GhostFlame's levels to be fairly linear with various styles of branching paths that require 
                player mastery over movement and memorization of level layout. I want a smooth run of a level to feel
                like a bullet tearing its way through the air until it reaches its target. I achieve this through the 
                level gimmicks that encourage high speed play. Hub areas serve as a space to freely run around, allow 
                player's to have urgency over their next objective, but 
                most importantly to introduce a level through a small challenege that foreshadows the next stage's focus.-->

            <h1>SONIC DISCOVERY</h1>
            <p>A Sonic the Hedgehog fan-game created and submitted to the 2021 Sonic Amateur Games Expo (SAGE). 2D momentum-based platformer
                This was my first released game and second video game developed. During the development process of this game I started realizing
                that designing levels was an extremely interesting aspect to me. This continued as I worked on more and more projects as I pushed 
                myself to emphasize level design as a core part of my digital experiences. I am still proud of the way I designed the stages 
                for this game.

            <p>Programmed in Game Maker Studio 1.4 using Flicky 8, a Sonic gameplay framework created by F4LK. My Work: Designed & Developed two completely orignal stages with sprawling and replayable level design. Designed & Developed tutorial 
                stages for each of the three playable characters. Created orignal artwork for title screen, menus, gameplay, and UI. Programmed in-game controller support. 
                Developed orignal gimmicks, stage objects, and set pieces. Designed & Developed orignal special stages accesable 
                through checkpoints.  Accolades: over 12,000 
                downloads & stellar reviews for inventive level design, a creative artstyle, and exciting set pieces.</p>
                      
            <h1>LEVEL DESIGN</h1>
            <p> Level design is based on the three path philosophy found in early Sonic the Hedgehog games. This will sometimes 
                funnel into a one or two path structure to keep the stages more focused. Evolved by adding more variation 
                with verticallity, set peices, and new gimmicks. Acessing higher routes is achieved by learning the physics 
                and level design by replaying the stage. Higher routes usually reward the player with a faster time and 
                continued flow throughout the stage. These diagrams show various snippets of level design and how I approched 
                designing it.</p>

            <h1>ARTWORK</h1>
            <p> I wanted this game to have more of a mix between cartoon aesthetics & realism as I really wanted to sell the feeling of a bustling
                cityscape. This is all of the sprite art I contributed to the project, most of everything thing else used in the project were assets 
                from <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/" class="text-link">Spriter's Resource</a> and old Sonic games. Most of what I worked on was
                art for the physical geometry: slopes, platforms, etc. and some background assets like signage. I also created various redesigns 
                of existing objects such as springs, ramps, and item monitors.
